# Car_Dataset_Analysis_Using_Python
In this repository I have taken a big dataset of Car Manufacturer and analyzed it to get useful insights from it using python.
Here the data of different car is given with their specifications
The data is available in csv file. We are going to analyze the dataset using python pandas.


Then data cleaning performed and then I have answered some common queston arising from the dataset-
Q-> What are the different types of make in our dataset? And what are 
the count of each make?

Q-> Show all the records where origin is Asia or Europe.

Q-> Remove all the records where Weight is above 4000 (rows)  etc.
